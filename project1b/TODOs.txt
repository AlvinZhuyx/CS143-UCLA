1. addActorDirector.php
Cannot parse the dob in some browser, appearing 0000-00-00.

2. addComments.php
Better the way how comment is adding.
So far user can only add comment using movie id, which is too inconvenient. Proposed embed a small search engine here and allow adding using movie name.

3. *.php
Make it look pretty.
Refine the font, layout, table and other appearance.
